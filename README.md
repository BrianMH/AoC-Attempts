# AoC-Attempts

Figured I might as well do this for fun since I seem to be cramming a bunch of other stuff and there might be something interesting that I get filtered by later on.

Also, please don't look too far into this since it's almost guaranteed to contain stylistic and executable nightmares eventually and even less likely to look polished due to the
way the leaderboard works.

I'll split it up by year and maybe look into previous years whenever I'm bored...
