# Problem:
#     Given a sequence of pseudo-assembly code and the assumption
#     that an addx op takes 2 cycles and noop takes 1 cycle with
#     a CPU with only a single register, find the sum of the values
#     on the register at the start of the "interesting" cycle 
#     values of (20 + 40*n).
#
# Observation:
#     We are simulating a single thread computer with specific operation times.
#     We can "queue" an operation and then wait the appropriate cycle
#     time for it to finish.

# Problem:
#     We now know our register represents the mid position of a 3-char
#     wide element being moved across the screen. Suppose we are using
#     a CRT that is 40 x 6 and update the value of the screen to be
#     turned on only if any pixel of the three-char-wide element is
#     located on the updated pixel in question.
#     It's pretty much the same as above but the mid-cycle action
#     has now been swapped out for something different. Refactoring
#     based on some mid-cycle functor can prob work, but it's more
#     effort than necessary for this.
